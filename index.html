    <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
    <p>Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
    <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.

<h3>Geographical location: Europe</h3>
<p>Barcelona, is a beautiful city on the Northeastern coast of Spain that is the byproduct of a rich and artistic history with 
  modern infrastructure. One of the main attractions of the city is its gorgeous architecture, often the work of world renowned 
  architects such as Antoni Gaudi. Some of the most notable works are the modern Basilica of La Sagrada Familia, and the tranquil 
  and eloquent Park Güell.
</p>

<p>Much of Barcelona’s charm comes down to local culture, from diverse culinary offerings, to the sunny vacation-ridden atmosphere 
  of the beaches, and even the symbolism of nationalism and independence that Barcelona residents display. The passion of the locals 
  is unwavering, including in famous soccer matches by one of the sports greatest clubs: F.C. Barcelona, and in numerous local artistry
   events. It is no wonder why many travelers to Spain feel rejuvenated and fortunate enough to have experienced the city’s irresistibly
    strong culture and atmosphere.
